khatam: Reducing the Communication Complexity of Code-Based SNARKs
Abstract
We prove that Basefold(Crypto 2024) is secure in the list decoding regime, within
the double Johnson bound and with error probability O(n)
|F|
. At the heart of this proof
is a new, stronger statement for correlated agreement, which roughly states that if a
linear combination of vectors πL + rπR agrees with a codeword at every element in
S ⊂ [n], then so do πL, πR. Our result is purely combinatorial and therefore extends
to any finite field and any linear code. As such, it can be applied to any coding-based
multilinear Polynomial Commitment Scheme to reduce its communication complexity.
